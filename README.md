## 🧠 How I Work
I’m a builder at heart. My approach to marketing is simple:
1. Understand the tech — how it works, why it matters.  
2. Translate complexity into clarity.  
3. Build programs that scale adoption and drive revenue.  

You’ll see that theme across everything here: developer empathy, clean storytelling, and measurable results.
